title: About Amazon Web Services
---

A short history of Amazon Web Services is contained in this [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/). Amazon was expanding fast and their infrastructure was struggling to cope. Inadvertently they became experts on data centre technology and later opened up the platform to developers. It became no longer necessary for startups to invest in servers and infrastructure, as they could now rent capacity solely based on their usage. The result was that all manner of companies now use AWS as their backend.

## What does this mean for normal folk?

For a normal person, AWS is cheap and powerful. Unfortunately it's aimed at developers and is therefore hard to set up and configure, which is why I've written this site.

Here are some useful things you can do with AWS:

* Hosting your websites
* Storing files online
* Managing web domains and subdomains
* Sending and receiving email through a custom domain. You can also configure GMail as your email client
* Use Amazon's free SSL service, which means you can have `https://` in your URL and that nice padlock in your address bar

The elephant in the room here is WordPress (and maybe Drupal and Joomla), which rely on scripting and databases to function. Although you *can* use AWS to host a WordPress site, setting this up and maintaining it is too complicated for me.
