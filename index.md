title: About Amazon Web Services
---

A short history of Amazon Web Services is contained in this [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/). Amazon was expanding fast and their infrastructure was struggling to cope. Inadvertently they became experts on data centre technology and later opened up the platform to developers. It became no longer necessary for startups to invest in servers and infrastructure, as they could now rent capacity based on usage. The result was that all manner of companies are using AWS as their backend.

## What does this mean for us normal folk?
