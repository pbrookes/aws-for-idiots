A short history of Amazon Web Services is contained in this [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/).

It became no longer necessary for startups to invest in servers, as they could rent capacity based on usage. And now, all manner of coppanies are running on AWS.
