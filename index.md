title: About Amazon Web Services
---

A short history of Amazon Web Services is contained in this [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/). Amazon was expanding fast and their infrastructure was struggling to cope. Inadvertently they became experts on data centre technology and later opened up the platform to developers. It became no longer necessary for startups to invest in servers and infrastructure, as they could now rent capacity based on usage. The result was that all manner of companies now use AWS as their backend.

## What does this mean for normal folk?

For a normal person, AWS is cheap and powerful. Unfortunately it's aimed at developers and is therefore hard to configure for normal people, which is why I've written this site.

Here's some things you can do with AWS:

* Hosting websites
* Storing files online
* Managing web domains and subdomains
* Sending and receiving email through a custom domain. You can also configure GMail as your email client
* Use Amazon's free SSL service, which means you can have https:// hosting and the nice padlock in your address bar
