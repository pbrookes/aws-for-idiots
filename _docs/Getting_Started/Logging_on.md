Go to [aws.amazon.com/console](https://aws.amazon.com/console), then go to **My Account** > **AWS Management Console** in the top menu bar.

You will then be prompted to log in with your Amazon account. If you don't already have one, you can also register from this page.

You will then be confronted by a baffling number of AWS services; if they are not visible, they can be selected via **Services** in the top menu.

The main services of interest to us are:

1. Storage > [S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3)
2. Network & Content Delivery > [Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53)
3. Network & Content Delivery > [Cloudfront](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront)
