Below is an explanation of the pricing structure, as far as I understand it. Prices are in US dollars.

The setup I describe on this site uses the following AWS services:

* **S3**—for storage
* **Route 53**—put simply, this ensures all your disparate elements (host, URLs and so on) are pointing at one other
* **Cloudfront**—this makes copies of your pages and distributes them to servers worldwide. It's also necessary to use this if you want secure hosting (a padlock, along with an https:// in the URL)

S3 is very cheap indeed and amounts to pennies per month, even if your website is really popular. Route 53 incurs the biggest charge and costs $0.50 per month for each domain you connect to it (brookes.tk in my examples). Cloudfront has been fairly inexpensive in my experience.

Amazon estimates charges of $1-3/month, which—if you include the secure hosting and email options—is very competitive.
