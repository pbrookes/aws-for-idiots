## A Domain Name

Kind of obvious, but AWS's default domains are neither memorable nor pretty. Who you buy your domain name from is really up to you. Amazon sell domains via their Route 53 service. I've personally had good experience with [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com). Sites such as [TLD List](https://tld-list.com) will compare prices across multiple vendors.

Be aware that some providers discount the first year of ownership, only to increase the fee when it's time to be renewed. Some vendors will also hide your personal details as part of the fee, while others will charge for this service.

For the tutorials on this site, I've registered a free .tk domain via [dot tk](http://www.dot.tk). This type of domain isn't  recommended for a professional website—they come across as being spammy—but it's something I can play around with for these tutorials, without the risk of messing up my personal website.
