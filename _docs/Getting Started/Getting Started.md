## A Domain Name

Kind of obvious, but AWS's default domains are neither memorable nor pretty. Who you buy your domain name from is really up to you. Amazon sell domains via their Route 53 service. I've personally had good experience with [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com). Sites such as [TLD List](https://tld-list.com) will compare prices across multiple vendors.

For the tutorials on this site, I've registered a free .tk domain via [dot tk](http://www.dot.tk). Not really recommended for a professional website, but it's something I can play around with, without the risk of messing up my personal domain.
